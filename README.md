**Key Insights**

**1. Engagement Trends Over Time**
- **Yearly Trend:** Engagements peaked in 2020 (3.54M) but have since fluctuated. There's a significant drop in 2025 (179K), suggesting a decline in user interaction or data collection gaps.
- **Quarterly Trend:** Q3 (8.00M) had the highest engagements, possibly due to seasonal factors or content performance during that period.
- **Monthly Trend:** August and September recorded the highest engagements, indicating a potential trend where engagements peak in late Q3.

**2. Engagement by Day**
- Sunday (5.19M) had the highest engagements, suggesting users are more active during weekends.

- Comedy (2.80M) and Vlogs (2.83M) had the lowest engagements, suggesting they may need optimization to improve user interaction.

**4. Top & Least Engaging Videos**
