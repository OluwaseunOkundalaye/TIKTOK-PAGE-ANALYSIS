**CONCLUSION**

The analysis highlights a strong engagement presence, with nearly 30 million total interactions, primarily driven by likes (88% of total engagements). The data indicates that engagement peaks in Q3, particularly in August and September, and is highest on Sundays. Dance, entertainment, and music content consistently outperform other categories across all engagement metrics (likes, comments, shares). However, there is a significant decline in 2025, suggesting possible algorithm changes, shifting audience behavior, or incomplete data.

To optimize future performance, the focus should be on leveraging high-performing content categories, refining hashtag strategies, and encouraging deeper audience interaction through comments. Additionally, scheduling content on high-engagement days (Sundays and Q3 months) and investigating the 2025 engagement drop will be key to sustaining growth.
